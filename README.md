Library for serializing and deserializing the tdf network format used by BlazeSDK which is present in games such as 
Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect Andromeda, Battlefield 3, etc (Lots of EA games). 

This is a re-write of my previous library [blazepk](https://github.com/jacobtread/BlazePK-rs). This version provides much more accurate 
naming and support for the different structures along with a derive macro implementation.
